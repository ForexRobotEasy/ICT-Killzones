# ICT Killzones ReadMe File

This code is for the ICT Killzones custom indicator developed by Forex Robot Easy Team. The indicator is designed to identify specific time zones in the Forex market known as 'killzones' and perform actions based on those zones.

## Indicator Initialization

The indicator's initialization function sets the parameters for the indicator. It sets the number of digits used in the indicator's values and sets the indicator's short name as 'ICT Killzones'.

## Indicator Iteration

The indicator's iteration function calculates the ICT Killzones for each bar of data. It loops through the bars and checks if the bar's time falls within any of the defined killzones. If the time falls within a killzone, the indicator performs specific actions for that killzone.

## Killzone Functions

The code includes functions to check if a given time falls within a specific killzone. The killzones defined in the code are:

1. Asian Open Killzone: The time range is from 18:00 to 00:00.
2. London Open Killzone: The time range is from 2:00 to 5:00.
3. New York Open Killzone: The time range is from 7:00 to 9:00.
4. London Close Killzone: The time range is from 10:00 to 12:00.
5. London Open Silver Bullet: The time range is from 3:00 to 4:00.
6. New York AM Silver Bullet: To be determined.

Each killzone function takes a datetime parameter and checks if the given time falls within the specified time range. If the time falls within the range, the function returns true, otherwise it returns false.
